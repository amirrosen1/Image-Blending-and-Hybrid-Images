# Image Blending and Hybrid Images

## Overview

This project showcases sophisticated image processing techniques to create visually seamless blended images and hybrid
 images that reveal different details at varying distances. By leveraging Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids, the project
  achieves smooth transitions and frequency-based image integration.

## Features

- **Image Blending**: Seamlessly blends two images using a mask and multi-level pyramidal techniques.
- **Hybrid Images**: Creates images that display different visuals depending on the viewing distance by merging
 high-frequency and low-frequency components from two images.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV 4.9.0.80**
- **NumPy 1.26.4**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/image-processing-project.git


## How to Use
Image Blending
1.Ensure you have three images: two to blend and one mask.

2.Replace the paths in ex3.py with your own images for first_image_for_blending, second_image_for_blending, and mask.

3.Run the script to generate the blended image.

Creating Hybrid Images
1.Make sure you have two images to merge into a hybrid.

2.Update the paths in ex3.py for first_image_for_hybrid and second_image_for_hybrid.

3.Execute the script to create the hybrid image.
